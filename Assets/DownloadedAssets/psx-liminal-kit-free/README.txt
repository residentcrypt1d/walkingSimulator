PSX Liminal Kit Free
====================

15 modular PS1-style pieces to build the backrooms, taken from PSX Liminal Kit (142 backrooms,
poolrooms, playplace and hotel pieces, a pool sunk in, a ball pit, a claw machine, a lift, working
machines, a level to walk and solve):
https://heyheythere.itch.io/psx-liminal-kit
Low-poly, one 1024x1024 point-filtered texture atlas, the shading baked into vertex colours,
real-world scale (1 unit = 1 metre).

What's in the zip
-----------------
glb/        one file per piece, with its animations (the best format for Godot, Blender, three.js)
fbx/        one file per piece, with its animations as takes (Unreal, Unity, most 3D apps)
obj/        one file per piece, still (any 3D app)
textures/   atlas.png, the one texture every piece uses, and the seamless floor, wall and
            ceiling textures it tiles from, 128x128 a metre, for your own geometry
icons/      an icon per piece, 256x256 PNG with transparency
props.json  every piece: title, group, size, triangles, parts and animations
blender/    every piece in one .blend, the atlas packed in
addons/     the Godot addon, psx_liminal_kit/: this folder is a Godot 4.3+ project that opens on
            its gallery (.gdignore keeps Godot out of the other folders)

The grid
--------
Everything snaps to a 2 m grid, 3 m high. A floor or ceiling piece covers one 2 x 2 m cell, its
pivot at the cell's centre on the floor (a ceiling hangs 3 m above its pivot, so both go at the
same point). A wall is 2 m long and 0.2 m thick, centred on a cell's edge, its front facing -Y in
Blender (+Z in Godot, -Z in Unity); turn it 90 degrees for the other edges. A post fills the corner
where walls meet; the pillar stands in a room's middle, on a corner of its cells. The yellow door
goes in the doorway at its point; the door to nowhere stands on its own. The EXIT sign and the
vent go against a wall, 0.1 m off its line.

Godot 4.3 and later
-------------------
Copy addons/psx_liminal_kit/ into your project's addons/ folder. Each piece is a scene in props/:
drag it into your level and turn on grid snapping at 1 m. It has a box collider (StaticBody3D) on
each of its parts: a doorway's leave the way through clear and the doors' move with them. A piece
with animations has an AnimationPlayer:

    door.get_node("AnimationPlayer").play("open")   # door: the yellow door in your level

An animation plays there and back (the door opens and shuts): pause it halfway to leave it open.
demo/gallery.tscn shows every piece: drag to turn, arrows to browse, A for all of them.
PSX Liminal Kit uses the same addon folder: it installs over this one.
The pieces use one material, props.tres: the atlas times the vertex colours, lit, so your lights
fall on them. For the full PS1 look (vertex snap, affine textures, 240p, dither), our PSX Look
shaders turn them over in one line: https://heyheythere.itch.io/psx-look
With PSX Look in res://addons/psx_look/, the gallery shows the pieces through it (P toggles it).

Other engines and apps
----------------------
Use fbx/, glb/ or obj/ with textures/atlas.png. Set the texture's filtering to nearest/point and
turn off mipmaps for the crisp PS1 texels, and multiply it by the vertex colours (the baked
shading) in your material.
